I originally thought that the best method to do this might be to use the join method and split method however I quickly realized why this might not work. Because it will fail whenever a string conntains a space such as "Hello World". This is because split will split every single string into single words in a list no matter what.

```python
class Solution:

    def encode(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        encoded = " ".join(strs)
        return encoded

    def decode(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        decoded = s.split()
        return decoded
```

> Time Complexity : `O()`
> 
> Space Complexity : `O()`

Okay so I watched the tutorial to complete the code. Essentially how it works is in order to actually make it so that we can effectively decode it the encoding needs to be done in a way that allows us to figure out when the words seperate and also how long the word itself is. Without the length of the word it might accidently recognize any symbol we use in this case `#` and seperate the words when its not supposed to e.g. Hel#lo -> ["Hel", "lo"] thats wrong the words should actually be recognizing the first instance at which `#` appears and then recognising the length of the actual string so we can seperate it and remake it properly.

I'll come back to see this question again in a few days and see if i'm able to compete it by myself without help but my understanding and problem solving feels like it really needs some work cause there is absolutly no way I was gonna figure that out myself. So sad...

```python
class Solution:

    def encode(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        result = ""
        for string in strs:
            result += str(len(string)) + "#" + string
        return result


    def decode(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        result, index = [], 0

        while index < len(s):
            j = index
            while s[j] != "#":
                j += 1
            length = int(s[index:j])
            result.append(s[j + 1 : j + 1 + length])
            index = j + 1 + length
        return result
```

This is really pmo because I don't have leetcode premium it shows I missed a day I DID NOT MISS A DAY grrr
