Is this just a brute force question? I think its possible to use hasing but let me first use brute force.

Currently the way i'm doing it or atleast my thoughts is to first check the rows using a nested loop and checking first if the value is currently a `.` if it is then we continue and check if we have seen the next value but first intializing a `seen` list. If it is then we know its `false` since we know that from 1-9 it each number can only appear once. Then if everything passes we add it to `seen`. Then we repeat the same for cols. 

The tricky part is when we have to think about how to approach the boxes



```python
class Solution(object):
    def isValidSudoku(self, board):

        # Check rows
        for row in range(9):
            seen = set()
            for i in range(9):
                if board[row][i] == ".":
                    continue
                if board[row][i] in seen:
                    return False
                seen.add(board[row][i])

        # Check columns
        for col in range(9):
            seen = set()
            for i in range(9):
                if board[i][col] == ".":
                    continue
                if board[i][col] in seen:
                    return False
                seen.add(board[i][col])   

        # Check 3x3 squares
        for square in range(9):
            seen = set()
            for i in range(3):
                for j in range(3):
                    row = (square // 3) * 3 + i
                    col = (square % 3) * 3 + j
                    if board[row][col] == ".":
                        continue
                    if board[row][col] in seen:
                        return False
                    seen.add(board[row][col])

        return True
```
