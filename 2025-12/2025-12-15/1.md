Its the infamous two sum! I've probably redone this question like a billion times but lets see if I remember how to do it.

I'm gonna use a brute force method first and then afterwards work into enumeration since I do remember that being the best method.

1. Brute force method involves nested loops going through the list with index `i` and index `j` (Which one step ahead of index i) and adding values until you find the correct target value, then output the index of the combination values. It was pretty easy to implement, however one caveat I ran into was that my python must be super rusty cause I did.

```python
for j in range(len(nums) + 1)

# Instead of the below 

for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
```

Its a minor but annoying mistake that I didn't like that I made, I guess its why i'm doing this in the first place essentially what the first python output would do is it would add one to the length of the array `nums` instead of starting from one forward of index `i`. 

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        index = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    index.append(i)
                    index.append(j)
        return index
```
