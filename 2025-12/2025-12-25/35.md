This is a binary search implementation because its a sorted list. Binary search the space by halving the middled index compare the middle element of the serach space with the input and if the key is the middle element then its done. Otherwwise choose which half is better to go towards e.g. bigger or smaller and split then its continued until the end.

The implementation is once again pretty simple since its legit just binary search. But tomorrow onwards i'm gonna be grinding out harder questions. Merry Christmas! 

```python
class Solution(object):
    def searchInsert(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """

        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2

            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif nums[mid] > target:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        
        return left
```
