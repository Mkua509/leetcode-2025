My thoughts is we use a two pointer technique. Keep Pointer `i` to track the position of the last unique element well `j` scans throught he array and finds new values that have not appeard. Because its already sorted duplicates will be next to each other.

So i did it like this:

1. Initialize the first index to be 0 (`index i`) This represents the index of last unique number 
2. Start looping through `j` from index `1` till we get to the very end of the array
3. for each `nums[j]` if it is different from `nums[i]` its a new unique value and we move `i` forward by , then we copy `nums[j]` into `nums[i]`.
4. After loop, the first `ī + 1` elements of `nums` contains all the unique values
5. Now we can just return `i + 1` as final count of unique values. 

Because we are modifying the array in place the space complexity will stay the same as no extra space is being used. Each element will also only be visited once.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        i=0

        for j  in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[j] != nums[i]:
                i += 1
                nums[i] = nums[j]
        
        return i + 1
        
```
