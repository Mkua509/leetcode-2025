Essentially given a string consisting of words and spaces, return the length of final word. 

its pretty similar to a previous question i've done before. The best thing to do in this case would most likely be to first find the final point of the list as a pointer, and iterate backwards until there isn't any hanging spaces. Then create a second pointer pointing to the end of the list that isn't a space e.g. the previously found pointer and iterate until you find the start of the word (This would be a space). Then you just return the values by subtracting end - start.

I once again chose a easy question due to it being near christmas (Christmas Eve rn) i'll get back into the neetcode grind but I think I need some easy questions to clear my mind and gain some confidence. Merry Christmas!!

```python
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """

        # First find the last letter of the word
        end = len(s) - 1


        # While end is a space move end backwards until its no longer a space or is the start of the list
        while s[end] == " ":
            end -= 1
        

        # Then we start iteration of start from end, then move backwards until it reaches the first space 
        start = end
        while start >= 0 and s[start] != " ":
            start -= 1
        
        results = end - start
        # Return the length of list
        return results
```
